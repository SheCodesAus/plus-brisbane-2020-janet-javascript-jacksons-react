            <h2>Diversity from the start</h2>
        
            <p>We love our unique hosts and heroes!

            We believe that deep tech should start and continue to be a diverse and inclusive community. 
   
            We want to avoid the pitfalls of other industries that have tried to become diverse after the fact. 
   
            We believe that diversity of culture, gender, race, ethnicity, religious or spiritual beliefs, sexual orientation and ability are integral to getting the best out of people and technology. 
   
            We want hosts that hold meet-ups, learnings, meetings, courses, accelerators and conferences that cater to all things Deep Tech and all people Deep Tech. Because no one should be left out. 
   
            We have created a place where heroes can find event hosts that align with their values and ideals.
   
            We want to grow a thriving, welcoming, thoughtful and creative environment where you can be yourself. 
   
            Join us. Everybodyâ€™s welcome.</p>

            <h2>What is Deep Tech?</h2>

            <p>
            Many people have various determinations of what deep tech means but we use the term to in refer to the cutting -edge and disruptive technologies that are based on engineering innovations and scientific advances and discoveries. In 2019 the Boston Consulting Group and Hello Tomorrow reported that the most prominent deep tech fields included, advanced materials, advanced manufacturing, artificial intelligence, biotechnology. blockchain, robotics, photonics, electronics and quantum computing.  Innovations in these fields have the power to create new markets and disrupt existing ones. Deep tech often addresses societal and environmental challenges that impact everyday life.
